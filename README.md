### Method 4: Programmatic Usage

You can also use it as a module in your own Python scripts:

```python
from fide_extractor import FIDEDataExtractor

# Create extractor
extractor = FIDEDataExtractor()

# Extract data for multiple players
identifiers = ['22538496', '12528374', 'Magnus Carlsen']
players_data = extractor.extract_multiple_players(identifiers)

# Export to Excel
extractor.export_to_excel(players_data, 'my_players.xlsx')
```

## Example FIDE IDs

Here are some example FIDE IDs you can test with:

- **22538496** - (Example player)
- **12528374** - (Example player)
- **62506241** - (Example player)
- **1503014** - Magnus Carlsen
- **8603677** - Gukesh D
- **44129165** - Praggnanandhaa R

## Output

The program exports data to an Excel file with the following columns:

| FIDE ID | Name | Federation | Title | B-Year | Rating std | Rating rapid | Rating blitz |
|---------|------|------------|-------|--------|------------|--------------|--------------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Notes

- The program respects FIDE's servers by adding a 1-second delay between requests
- If a name search returns multiple results, the program uses the first match
- FIDE IDs are numeric identifiers (e.g., 22538496)
- Player names can be partial (e.g., "Carlsen" will find Magnus Carlsen)

## Alternative: Using the FIDE API

There's also an open-source REST API available at [fide-api](https://github.com/cassiofb-dev/fide-api) that you can use:

```bash
# Using the hosted API
curl https://fide-api.vercel.app/player/1503014
```

Or run it locally with Docker:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cassiofb-dev/fide-api
cd fide-api
docker compose up -d
```
